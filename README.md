# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection-using-CNN

Diabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness among working-age adults. Early detection of this condition is critical for good prognosis. 
In this project, we demonstrate the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on color fundus images for the recognition of diabetic retinopathy.
